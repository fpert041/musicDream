LEAP MOTION CONTROLLED UNREAL PROJECT
====================================


#W.I.P.

##Status:
Basic Unreal Engine 4 environment using Blueprint plug-in "Leap Motion" to render floating hands in a virtual space based on head mounted leap motion contorller.
(UE4 version: 14.3)
- Integrated Leap Motion API data into Unreal using GitNamo Plugin
- Converted Project to a 1st Person C++ Project with Blueprints built on top
- Created a 1st version of physics handling
- Desplayed outside world using Leap camera images

##TODO:
1)Continue experiment with physics and test with actors (would be controllers)
2)Display outside world to create an AR system
3)Have a functional Unreal project keeping track of the hands through the Leap API, having physics and matching this with outside world hands view
4)See if AR is possible: explore Unreal AR plugin based on ARToolkit
